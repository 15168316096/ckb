## Chain Spec

The subcommand `ckb init` has an option `--export-specs` to export spec files
as well, which allows editing the chain spec for development.

The chain spec can switch between different PoW engines. Wiki has the [instructions](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/PoW-Engines) about how to configure it.-

### Well-known Hashes

The command `ckb cli hashes` prints the well-known hashes for current
effective chain spec.

The file `docs/hashes.toml` contains the well-known hashes for all the bundled
chain specs. The file is generated by:

```
cargo run cli hashes -b > docs/hashes.toml
```
